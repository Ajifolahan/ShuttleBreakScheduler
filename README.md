# ShuttleBreakScheduler

This is a prototype of a system to improve the shuttle rides consistency at Quinnipiac University. This system assigns drivers break times after a particular time but makes sure that there are at least one big shuttle and 2 small shuttles running at all times. This makes the shuttle rides more efficient as students would have more access to them at all times. It also allows for students to report any delay for any driver. 

To run this program. Simply clone this repo and run in any IDE of your choice.
